p The server has fulfilled the partial GET request for the resource.  The request MUST have included a Range header field (section 14.35) indicating the desired range, and MAY have included an If-Range header field (section <a rel='xref' href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.27'>14.27</a>) to make the request conditional.

p The response MUST include the following header fields:

pre       - Either a Content-Range header field (section 14.16) indicating the range included with this response, or a multipart/byteranges Content-Type including Content-Range fields for each part. If a Content-Length header field is present in the response, its value MUST match the actual number of OCTETs transmitted in the message-body.

pre       - Date

pre       - ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent in a 200 response to the same request

pre       - Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might differ from that sent in any previous response for the same variant

p If the 206 response is the result of an If-Range request that used a strong cache validator (see section 13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers. If the response is the result of an If-Range request that used a weak validator, the response MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers. Otherwise, the response MUST include all of the entity-headers that would have been returned with a 200 (OK) response to the same request.

p A cache MUST NOT combine a 206 response with other previously cached content if the ETag or Last-Modified headers do not match exactly, see <a rel='xref' href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html#sec13.5.4'>13.5.4</a>.

p A cache that does not support the Range and Content-Range headers MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial) responses.

p If the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is allowed, but the document has not been modified, the server SHOULD respond with this status code. The 304 response MUST NOT contain a message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.

p The response MUST include the following header fields: 

pre - Date, unless its omission is required by section 14.18.1 

p If a clockless origin server obeys these rules, and proxies and clients add their own Date to any response received without one (as already specified by [RFC 2068], section <a rel='xref' href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.19'>14.19</a>), caches will operate correctly.  

pre - ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent in a 200 response to the same request 

pre - Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might differ from that sent in any previous response for the same variant 

p If the conditional GET used a strong cache validator (see section 13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers.  Otherwise (i.e., the conditional GET used a weak validator), the response MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers.  

p If a 304 response indicates an entity not currently cached, then the cache MUST disregard the response and repeat the request without the conditional.  

p If a cache uses a received 304 response to update a cache entry, the cache MUST update the entry to reflect any new field values given in the response.

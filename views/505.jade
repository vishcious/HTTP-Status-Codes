p The server does not support, or refuses to support, the HTTP protocol version that was used in the request message. The server is indicating that it is unable or unwilling to complete the request using the same major version as the client, as described in section <a rel='xref' href='rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.1'>3.1</a>, other than with this error message. The response SHOULD contain an entity describing why that version is not supported and what other protocols are supported by that server.

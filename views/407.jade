p This code is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but indicates that the client must first authenticate itself with the proxy. The proxy MUST return a Proxy-Authenticate header field (section <a rel='xref' href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.33'>14.33</a>) containing a challenge applicable to the proxy for the requested resource. The client MAY repeat the request with a suitable Proxy-Authorization header field (section <a rel='xref' href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.34'>14.34</a>). HTTP access authentication is explained in "HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication" <a rel='bibref' href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec17.html#bib43'>[43]</a>.
